# project_intermediate_star_schema_elt

## Project Path

This project builds on the foundational sales analytics work from Project 0
and prepares data for advanced customer analytics in Project 2.

[Project 0 — Sales Analytics (Beginner)](https://github.com/promiseekwurumadu/project_a_sales_beginners_analytics.git) →  
**Project 1 (this repo)** →  
[Project 2 — Advanced Sales Analytics & Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/promiseekwurumadu/Project_sales_analytics_advanced.git)


## Analytics

This project implements a star-schema warehouse and supports advanced analytics, including:

- Executive KPIs (revenue, orders, customers, AOV)
- Cohort-based retention analysis (monthly)
- RFM-based customer segmentation

Data is extracted and cleaned in Python, loaded into PostgreSQL using a dimension/fact model, and visualised in Power BI.

## Next Step: Project 2

In Project 2, the cleaned and structured sales data is used for
customer-level analytics, including RFM segmentation and retention analysis,
with dashboards built in Power BI.

**What Project 2 adds:**
- Customer segmentation (RFM)
- Retention and cohort analysis
- Python-based analytics
- Power BI dashboards
