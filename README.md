## Analytics

This project implements a star-schema warehouse and supports advanced analytics, including:

- Executive KPIs (revenue, orders, customers, AOV)
- Cohort-based retention analysis (monthly)
- RFM-based customer segmentation

Data is extracted and cleaned in Python, loaded into PostgreSQL using a dimension/fact model, and visualised in Power BI.
